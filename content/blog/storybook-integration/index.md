I was given the opportunity by our team to integrate a very useful tool called Storybook. Our frontend codebase grew exponentially and we needed a way to manage our existing components and build new components independently and in isolation. Storybook is a great fit for the problem.

Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application. Use Storybook to build small atomic components and complex pages in your web application. If it's a UI, you can build it with Storybook.Storybook can also help you document components for reuse and automatically visually test your components to prevent bugs. Extend Storybook with an ecosystem of addons that help you do things like fine tune responsive layouts or verify accessibility.
