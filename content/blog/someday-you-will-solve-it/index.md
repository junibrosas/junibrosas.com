# Someday you will solve it

I just got a wonderful day today because finally I was able to solve a problem I thought would be impossible to solve.

I had a problem with a particular widget that I am developing for the project. The widget is something like Google Help feedback which a user can take a screenshot of the page, add an issue description, and highlight/blackout a particular area of the page. I developed it firstly on my local machine. Soon after the thought that I had finished it. I uploaded it on a development site. No one on the team noticed the bug including me of course that the widget is cause the whole icons on the page to disappear whenever the widget is opened. It took about a month after one of my teammate noticed that there is something wrong on the page whenever the widget is opened. I then took a thorough investigate as to what caused the problem. After hours of dissecting my codes I cannot find the root of the problem. I moved to other tickets to utilise my time rather then burning it all to the ‘unknown’. I have finished my other tickets and I realised I am left with that ticket which I have no choice but to solve it before the week ends. It was Friday I started on that problem without any distraction with other tickets. I am so pissed already until I hunched that the screenshot library I used is outdated the found out that the library is caused the chaos. I sat down for the whole weekend until I finally solved it. And it was on Sunday that I thought I could finally sleep well without some unfinished work bugging me.

I realised that if you just sit down and dedicate your time and effort to solve the problem, it would probably take you days until you solve it, but someday you will be right. This scenario is pretty common in the programming world but I am sure it is also applicable in the real world with real problem. Be it a problem with your relationship, financial, studies, family, you will solve it.

Keep in mind that you have to relax as well. Relaxation is the only way we can fix the issues the best way we can.
